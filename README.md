# Project Name: CIOT Logistics Network

This comprehensive project includes multiple components tailored to support the logistics network, divided into separate directories to maintain modularity and clarity. Each component has its specific setup and operational instructions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

- `/dashbaord` - Contains the Next.js application for the web interface. Detailed setup and operational instructions are provided within this directory in its own `README.md`.
- `/lambda functions.zip` - Includes the zipped files for AWS Lambda functions.
- `/physical tracker.zip` - Houses the zipped Swift code used for the physical tracker.

## Note: The EKS cluster has been deleted since the end of the project. While all code is valid, you will not be able to view any data on the dashboard.
